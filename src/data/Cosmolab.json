	"description": "Young adults often encounter many difficulties when learning complex and abstract science topics in school. Students should be able to learn these subjects in a more engaging and stimulating process to promote deeper comprehension and reconceptualization of the physical world. <br><br> Designed as a new way of teaching, CosmoLab is a web-based educational tool that allows students to act as scientists, performing experiments and making discoveries within new perspectives of our universe. Through narration, animation, and interactivity, complex concepts become relatable and easy to comprehend. <br><br> This project was my senior thesis for the University of Cincinnati. I am responsible for the problem identification, design research, branding, style, script, and the final animation."
